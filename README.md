BLE-web-interface
=================

Registers nearby BLE devices on a webpage served by a Tessel.

You have the option to pre-register devices into the code if you want them to show up with a name next to them.

This could be useful if you just want to know what BLE devices are around youâ€“ or if a group of people regularly carry BLE-broadcasting devices (e.g. Fitbits or phones), you could register them into the code and use this for a roll-call of who is present.
